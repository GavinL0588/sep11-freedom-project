 Iâ€™ll use DOM practices that I learned during class to connect the wow.js and animate.css to make it html and JS connected. 
	The design of the work will be the scroll list where I will put a few animations they want on the side, what word they want to type and will play a display of the animation. I will also put a reset button so if the user clicks on the button then the animation will disappear and the word will reset so the user can put in a new one . 

I tried to use these class as an example on how they would work 
Not only the code works for text but it can also work for pictures too!
I learned that I can animate as long as the code for it is in the class.

I plan on having multiple of these animations but with the scroll menu inputting the correct animation and will make it print from JS on to HTML.
