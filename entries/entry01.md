I started to try out 3D Rendering with babylon.js (https://www.babylonjs.com/) to get some ideas and starting code on my ideas at the moment.
I might use some outside sources like LuxRender, Freestyle, and Pixar's Renderman to try rendering my final product to see if it works correctly. 

I am just messing around with some code on the examples in babylon.js, the most I did was change the color since I do not want to mess up and break the code and not understand what happened. 

At the moment I dont know what in class I am learning that will help me in doing 3D rendering, maybe variables and colors are going to be useful in 3D rendering. 

Some skills I might take is googling when I need help, debugging since that is very important to revise and fix the code, embrace failuare since nothing will work the first time, and collaboration since maybe some people have the same idea and can work with me on it.
