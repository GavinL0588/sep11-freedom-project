I decided to change to wow.js(https://wowjs.uk/) since I had no idea on how to do 3D rendering or modeling like Baylon requires. I decided to do wow.js since it is an easier step and it is animations. I can use Jsbin to test some random animation to see how it works. I can use these animations to maybe make a simulator or a website itself. I learned some basics from last year if animation with css but using Java script is new to me. I can start on had drawing an out what kind of animations I want to make a website. Doing this can help me imporve my creativity skills as a person since creating a website needs a lot of creativity to look nice and not boring. Some sources I can use are Anime.js, Three.js,Ani.JS and many more. Some skills I can use is Creativity since my animation and creation might be able to teach someone about it.
