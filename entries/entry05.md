I got my ideas to work and did some tweaking that the person has to manually type what they want to see on the site.
My projects are directly towards younger people who are new since it is super basic but basic knowledge is a good starting point. it debugging it was not that easy as it seems. I found an easy solution on how to make my code work so I am planning to put pictures around it to make it colorful.  Mine is more html and css heavy but uses JS elements to make it work more smoothly compare to just full html and css since with JS I can compact the code smaller and more efficient.
