Tweaking the animation making sure the picture and text can be displayed correctly, added an option where the user can input a number 0-9 to see a specific animation they want to see, I learned that some codes can be similar and work in the same way and adding more animation to put more options on there and control the speed of the animation to my liking.
I learned that using the DOM challenge code makes it similar and it provided me less stress to think of something that can stress me out since the DOM challege code is efficent and easier since I learned and can replicate it in future projects
