Today I practiced and tried some things out on wow.js(https://wowjs.uk/) and animate.css(https://animate.style/) like how to animate picture movements. 

I learned that I need to use a special command to be able to connect the project and the website that was hosting all the animation  
(https://imgur.com/a/wCIWbWj) (this shows that I need to have those special command taht connects the website and my project through npm or yarn, without them the animation won't work.) 

The animation only works with the HTML and CSS but I will continue to try to make it work on JS. So far I learned that.
I already know how my tool works but I need to find a way on how to make it a JS that is interactive. 

  -I plan on making something that lets the user choose what words they want to animate and which animation to choose from. 

I also learned that I can easily do animation delay with a special class code (https://imgur.com/a/ESjDrrn) and (https://imgur.com/S3ogf7Z) which were examples on how to long you can delay your animation as you want. 

I leanred that I can't use document.write() or console.log() with the animation in the same class in JS so I will try to make a prompt then connect it to the HTML to make it work out. 

A skill I learned was "How to learn" ("LOYO"), It is because last year in SEP10 I also learned about animation which uses keyframes and does a small animation like changing color of the text but compare to wow.js and animate.css it was completely different and that keyframe can't do fancy animations like how wow.js and animate.css does.
